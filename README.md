City Builder Simulation
![alt text](994928.jpg)
Introduction
Urbanization has been a defining trend in human civilization, shaping societies, economies, and the environment. Managing the growth and sustainability of a city involves complex decision-making processes that balance infrastructure development, resource allocation, citizen satisfaction, and governance.

We are tasked with developing a City Builder Simulation in C++, where the focus is not only on constructing buildings but also on managing efficient systems that ensure the well-being of citizens and the prosperity of the urban environment.

The simulation requires the application of various design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. By managing elements such as buildings, utilities, transportation, citizens, and government functions, we will demonstrate our ability to design and implement complex software systems using object-oriented principles and design patterns.

Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

Identify and analyze the functional requirements of a city-building simulation.
Translate these requirements into a software design using appropriate design patterns.
Develop UML diagrams to represent the system design and interactions.
Implement the designed system in C++, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and modularity.
Compile documentation detailing the design, implementation, and usage of the simulation.
Collaborate effectively within a team, utilizing version control and best coding practices.

Simulation Engine
At the core of the simulation is the Engine, which manages the dynamic interactions between different city components. The engine will handle key events such as:

Construction
Resource allocation
Taxation
Citizen needs and satisfaction
The engine will operate in either real-time or turn-based mode.
