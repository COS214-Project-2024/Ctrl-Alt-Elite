![994928](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd6cbcc1-5ed9-48c9-adb6-905875eaecb6)


# Introduction

Urbanization has been a defining trend in human civilization, shaping societies, economies, and the environment. Managing the growth and sustainability of a city involves complex decision-making processes that balance infrastructure development, resource allocation, citizen satisfaction, and governance.

This project involves developing a City Builder Simulation in C++, focusing not only on constructing buildings but also on managing efficient systems that ensure the well-being of citizens and the prosperity of the urban environment.

The simulation requires the application of various design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. By managing elements such as buildings, utilities, transportation, citizens, and government functions, we will demonstrate our ability to design and implement complex software systems using object-oriented principles and design patterns.

# Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

Identify and analyze the functional requirements of a city-building simulation.
Translate these requirements into a software design using appropriate design patterns.
Develop UML diagrams to represent the system design and interactions.
Implement the designed system in C++, ensuring clear separation of concerns and modularity.
Compile documentation detailing the design, implementation, and usage of the simulation.
Collaborate effectively within a team, utilizing version control and best coding practices.
